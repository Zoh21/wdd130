    <h2>Ouokanouon Zoh</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone. You can call me Ouokanouon Zoh or Zoh.
         I'm from Ivory Coast and I'm currently living in Abidjan the capital town of my country.
         I have been a member of the church for almost 6 years now.
         I said almost because it has yet reached 6 years.
         I served a full time mission in Ghana Kumasi Mission from 2018 to 2020.
         I am single but planning to get married this year 2022.
         This class is toward my second certificate, previous certicate was <strong>Computer Support Certificate</strong>. This class is my passion yet i don't have any experience. Hopefully i will get some through yours. My major is <strong>Applied Technology</strong> I love listening to all the prophets of the church.
